# Evals

This folder contains evaluation definitions and supporting documents.

## Intended layout

- `runs/`: **local evaluation runs** (ignored by git)
- Everything else: eval definitions, fixtures, and lightweight documentation (tracked)

## MVP1

MVP1 does not implement an eval runner here; it only establishes a stable place for eval definitions and run outputs.
