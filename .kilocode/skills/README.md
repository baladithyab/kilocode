# Skills

Skills are reusable, repo-specific playbooks that describe _how to do work here_.

A skill should be:

- **Actionable**: steps, checklists, and concrete examples
- **Scoped**: focused on one workflow or capability
- **Auditable**: references to relevant code paths and constraints

## Suggested structure

- Problem statement
- Preconditions / required context
- Steps
- Safety checks (what must not happen)
- Verification

## Change policy

Skills changes should generally go through the propose/apply workflow in [`../evolution/`](.kilocode/evolution/README.md:1).
