# Rubrics

Rubrics define **how we evaluate** agent outputs and changes.

Keep rubrics:

- **Observable** (based on artifacts/tests)
- **Specific** (avoid vague language)
- **Reusable** across tasks

## MVP1

MVP1 focuses on:

- Governance compliance (least privilege, propose/apply)
- Documentation quality (local-first, auditability)
- Safety (no secrets, no destructive edits)
